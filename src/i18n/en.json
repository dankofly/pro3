      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need experience for paragliding?",
        "answer": "No experience is needed at all. You fly with a certified tandem pilot who handles all the controls. You just need to take a few running steps downhill at launch – the pilot does the rest."
      },
      {
        "question": "What should I wear for a tandem flight?",
        "answer": "Sturdy shoes (hiking boots ideal, no sandals), long trousers and a jacket or fleece. At 2,220m on the Zettersfeld it's noticeably cooler than in the valley. We also recommend sunglasses and sun protection."
      },
      {
        "question": "From what age can children do a tandem flight?",
        "answer": "There is no fixed minimum age. What matters is that the child can understand the pilot's instructions and run a few steps independently at launch. In our experience, this works well from about age 5–6."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens in bad weather?",
        "answer": "Safety always comes first. If weather conditions aren't suitable, we reschedule your flight free of charge to the next available date. That's why we contact you beforehand to find the optimal time together."
      },
      {
        "question": "Where is the meeting point for the tandem flight?",
        "answer": "We arrange the exact meeting point based on weather and the chosen launch site (Zettersfeld or Hochstein). We usually meet near the valley station or at our landing zones near Nussdorf-Debant."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are photos and videos of the flight available?",
        "answer": "Yes, with the media package (from €170) you receive professional GoPro footage – photos and HD video on a 4GB SD card, right after landing. With the Classic package, recordings can be added optionally."
      },
      {
        "question": "How safe is tandem paragliding?",
        "answer": "Tandem flights with KOFLY are conducted exclusively by state-certified pilots with certified EN/LTF equipment. Daniel Kofler has been flying since 1999 with over 5,000 flight hours. Whether we fly always depends on current weather conditions."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I fly if I'm afraid of heights?",
        "answer": "Yes! Many of our passengers are initially nervous about heights. Most report that paragliding feels completely different from standing on a mountain – more like gentle floating. The pilot can adjust the flight experience to your comfort level at any time."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are gift vouchers available?",
        "answer": "Yes, all flight packages are available as gift vouchers – a perfect present for birthdays, Christmas or special occasions. You can pick up the voucher from us or receive it by post. Just contact us via WhatsApp or phone."
